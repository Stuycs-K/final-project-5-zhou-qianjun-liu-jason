## Group Info
We are making a game that features a series of randomized rooms in floors in a system similar to a roguelite. Each floor will consist of an entrance/lobby, exit/portal, training room and a series of combat and encounter rooms. The combat system will be a grid based combat system consisting of many phases: movement, attack direction, attack type, enemy turn, and many comfirmation steps. The map will consist of enemy locations, and player location. Players will begin with three skills but can swap them around when reaching the training room. These skills— with unique ranges and damage —can be changed exclusively in the training room through a menu. Each enemy has their own sepcific HP and damage range which forces the enemies to move to a optimal spot to deal damage to you. 
## Overview

## Instructions
There should be no such excess instructions nessesary.

You will start off in the enterence room (blue box on minimap) where you will be allowed to move the entire time you are there. Once you move to the right hand wall you will be instantly transported to the next room.
Then you will go into one of three different types of room:
1) Combat room: (red box on minimap) You will spawn on the side you "traveled down" and you will start in the movement phase. Then read the directions on the bottom left hand to attack and kill the enemies. Once all enemies are dead you will be automatically transported to the next room. Currently we have made the forcefeild very broken in order to clear the game since it is very difficult since the enemies are well ballenced.
2) Training rooms: (paige box on minimap) You will spawn in the center of the room. You can choose 3 skills on the bottom left hand side of the screen. Once you click three different skills and they show up below the list of possible skills you will be automatically transported to the next room.
3) Encounter rooms: (light green box on minimap) You will spawn on the left hand side and there is a beacon in the center of the room. Once you are within range of the beacon it will heal you for 25 hp and then disapear. You need to reach the right hand wall in order to advance to the next room.

At the end of a long list of these rooms you will see another blue box. That is the exit box. You will spawn halfway between the exit portal and the wall and the instant you touch that exit portal you will be transfered to the next realm where there is a host of different mobs.
Suppose you survive all 3 floors, the last exit portal will bring you to the end screen.
